 # Ideas

You can start writing your thoughts down and taking the ideas out of your head.

You may find that seen them written gives you a different perspective about them.

You can also use this to record bouts of inspiration you may have throughout the day.

Thanks to the use of the "wiki-links" you can start finding the common themes among them.

Experiment and create your own workflow, take ideas from elsewhere and make this your _own_.
